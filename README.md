# Java Learning Journey
Welcome to my Java Learning Journey repository! This project documents my daily progress as I learn Java programming, including code exercises, notes, and mini-projects. My goal is to build a strong foundation in Java, practice version control with Git, and create a portfolio to showcase my skills.

## About This Repository  
This repository serves as a record of my self-paced Java learning journey, starting in June 2025. It includes:  
- Daily coding exercises organized by date or topic.
- Notes summarizing key concepts and reflections on my learning.
- Small projects to apply what I've learned in practical scenarios.
- A progress tracker to highlight milestones and topics covered.  

Whether you're a fellow learner, mentor, or potential employer, I hope this repository provides insight into my growth as a Java developer!  

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
```
JavaLearningJourney/
├── docs/
│   ├── notes/                # Markdown files with daily summaries and reflections
│   └── resources/            # Tutorials, cheatsheets, and external references
├── src/                      # Source code for daily exercises
│   ├── day1/                 # Day 1: Hello World, JShell
│   ├── day2/                 # Day 2: Basic Java, Condition 
│   └── ...                   # Additional daily or topic-based folders
├── projects/                 # Mini-projects (e.g., calculator, games)
│   ├── calculator/           # Example project: Simple calculator
│   └── ...                   # Other projects
├── README.md                 # This file
└── .gitignore                # Ignores compiled .class files, IDE configs, etc.
```

- *docs/notes/*: Contains markdown files with summaries of concepts learned each day (e.g., [day1-jshellbasic.md](docs/notes/day1-jshellbasic.md)).
- *docs/resources/*: Stores links to tutorials, articles, or cheatsheets I find helpful.
- *src/*: Organized by day or topic, containing Java code files (e.g., HelloWorld.java).
- *projects/*: Dedicated to larger, multi-file projects built to apply my skills.
## Progress Tracker
Below is a summary of my learning progress, updated regularly:

|  Day  |    Date    |     Topic     | Code |                              Notes                               |
|:-----:|:----------:|:-------------:|:----:|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Day 1 | 2025-06-12 | JShell Basics |  -   | [docs/notes/day1-jshellbasic.md](docs/notes/day1-jshellbasic.md) |
***_note_***: This table will be updated as I progress through my learning journey.
## How to Run the Code
To run the Java code in this repository, follow these steps:
1. **Prerequisites:**
     - Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later installed.
     - A code editor like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code (optional but recommended).
2. **Steps:**
     - Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/iftekharalamfahim/JavaLearningJourney.git
   ```
     - Navigate to the desired code folder (e.g., src/day1/):
   ```shell
   cd JavaLearningJourney/src/day1
   ```
     - Compile the Java file:
   ```shell
   javac HelloWorld.java
   ```
     - Run the compiled program:
   ```shell
   java HelloWorld
   ```
3. **Notes**:
   - Ensure your JDK version matches the code requirements (most code uses Java 17+).
   - Some projects in the `projects/` folder may have additional instructions in their own `README.md` files.
## Goals and Motivation
My goals for this repository are:
- Learn Java fundamentals (variables, loops, OOP, collections, etc.).
- Build practical projects to reinforce my skills.
- Develop proficiency in Git and GitHub for version control.
- Create a portfolio to demonstrate my progress to potential employers or collaborators.
  I’m motivated to become a proficient Java developer and contribute to open-source projects in the future. This repository is a step toward that goal!
